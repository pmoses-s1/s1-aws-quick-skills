"""
Unit test for the isLegacy=false safety net in s1_client.py.

Why this exists
---------------
GET /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules silently omits queryType="scheduled"
PowerQuery rules from the response unless isLegacy=false is passed on the
query string. There is no error, no warning — the response just lies by
omission. This has bitten us multiple times: "list my scheduled detections"
returns an empty list even though scheduled rules exist and are visible in
the console UI.

To prevent the same mistake recurring, s1_client.S1Client.request() auto-
injects isLegacy=false on every GET to /cloud-detection/rules (including
the single-rule /{id} variant and trailing-slash forms). This test pins
that behavior so regressions surface immediately.

The corresponding JS guard lives in
  sentinelone-mcp/tools/mgmt-console.js  (normalizeS1ApiGetParams)
Keep the two in sync.

Run
