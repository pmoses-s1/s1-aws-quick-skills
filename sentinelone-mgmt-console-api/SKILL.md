description: Use whenever the user wants to query, update, create, or act on a SentinelOne Management Console — threats, alerts, agents, sites, accounts, groups, exclusions, RemoteOps, Deep Visibility, Hyperautomation, Unified Alert Management (UAM), Purple AI, IOCs, or any other S1 Mgmt API resource. Trigger on "console", "query/update/create console", "SentinelOne", "S1", "Singularity", "UAM", "Purple AI", "/web/api/v2.1/...", S1 agent/threat/site IDs, or asks like "list endpoints", "triage alerts", "add note to alert", "create an IOC", "isolate endpoint", "run RemoteOps", "pull DV results". For alerts the PRIMARY API is GraphQL UAM at /web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql; REST /cloud-detection/alerts is SECONDARY (older, cloud-detection scoped, int64 IDs). Defer to Purple MCP if the user says "purple mcp" or "mcp"; this skill is the backup then. Wraps the S1 Mgmt REST API (781 ops, 113 tags, v2.1) plus UAM GraphQL and Purple AI GraphQL, with a Python client, searchable index, and reversible tests.

# SentinelOne Management Console API

Wraps the SentinelOne Management Console API (Swagger 2.0, spec version 2.1, 781 operations) with a pre-built Python client, a compact endpoint index, and per-tag reference files.

> **Sandbox proxy blocked?** If calls to `*.sentinelone.net` fail with a connection or proxy error inside the Amazon Quick sandbox, use the `sentinelone-mcp` server instead. It runs locally on your machine via `node` and bypasses the sandbox proxy entirely. Setup: add it in Amazon Quick Settings > Capabilities > MCP. The MCP server exposes all the tools in this skill — `s1_api_get`, `s1_api_post`, `purple_ai_alert_summary`, `uam_list_alerts`, `uam_get_alert`, `uam_add_note`, `uam_set_status` — with schemas validated against the live API. For natural-language Purple AI queries and AI investigations, use the Purple MCP (`mcp__purple-mcp__purple_ai`) directly — those operations require a browser-session teamToken that API tokens never obtain.

## Setup — configure credentials first

Drop a `credentials.json` file directly into your repo folder with the required fields:

```json
{
  "S1_CONSOLE_URL": "https://usea1-acme.sentinelone.net",
  "S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN": "eyJ...your-api-token...",
  "S1_HEC_INGEST_URL": "https://ingest.us1.sentinelone.net"
}
```

`S1_CONSOLE_URL` is the tenant console URL (no trailing slash, no `/web/api/v2.1`). `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` is an API User token from Settings → Users → Service Users in the S1 console. `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` is the SentinelOne HEC ingest host (region-specific, look up yours in [SentinelOne Endpoint URLs by Region](https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000004961)) and is only required if you push alerts/indicators into UAM via the UAM Alert Interface.

The MCP server auto-discovers credentials from environment variables or by walking up the directory tree for `credentials.json`. To trigger a manual refresh:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_creds.sh   # idempotent, returns the destination path
```

Environment variables (`S1_CONSOLE_URL`, `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL`, `S1_VERIFY_TLS`) still override the credentials file if set.

Before running anything, confirm credentials resolved. If not, stop and ask the user to drop `credentials.json` into their repo folder.

## Workflow

When the user asks for something involving the S1 API, follow this pattern:

1. **Find the right endpoint.**
   - If the user's ask is verb-shaped ("list / count / isolate / hunt …") and you need orientation, read `references/CAPABILITY_MAP.md` first — it's a compact per-tag summary of what verbs each resource supports.
   - For a specific multi-step task ("threat triage", "endpoint isolation", "DV hunt"), `references/WORKFLOWS.md` has ready-to-adapt recipes.
   - Otherwise go straight to `scripts/search_endpoints.py` with a keyword matching the user's intent. It now ranks results by relevance (path segment hits + verb intent + tag) and supports synonyms ("isolate" → "disconnect", "endpoint" → "agent"). Add `--only-works` to restrict to endpoints confirmed reachable on this tenant by the most recent smoke test.
2. **Read the per-tag reference.** Open `references/tags/<Tag>.md` (names match the table in `references/TAG_INDEX.md`) to see full parameter lists, descriptions, required permissions, and response codes for that group. Only read the tag file(s) relevant to the task — don't read them all.
3. **Call the endpoint.** Either use `scripts/call_endpoint.py` for one-off calls, or import `S1Client` from `scripts/s1_client.py` in a Python script for anything that needs loops, joins, or transforms. For independent GETs, prefer `c.get_many([(path, params), ...])` — it fans out in parallel over the client's pooled connection and is ~3× faster than a sequential loop.
4. **Paginate correctly.** S1 list endpoints use cursor-based pagination. The client's `paginate()` and `iter_items()` handle this automatically — prefer them over manual `skip`/`limit` math, which caps at 1000 items.
5. **Summarize the result for the user.** Don't dump raw JSON unless asked. Prefer a short prose summary plus a table or CSV/XLSX if the volume warrants.

## GET vs POST: the rule you must follow

The S1 API uses **GET for every read operation** — listing, counting, and exporting. POST is only for actions and mutations. Violating this produces HTTP 404, not a permissions error, because the path simply does not exist.

**Read (always GET):**
| Intent | Correct endpoint |
|---|---|
| List agents | `GET /web/api/v2.1/agents` |
| Count agents | `GET /web/api/v2.1/agents/count` → `{"data":{"total":N}}` |
| List threats | `GET /web/api/v2.1/threats` |
| Count threats | `GET /web/api/v2.1/threats?countOnly=true` or check `pagination.totalItems` from any list call |
| Export threats to CSV | `GET /web/api/v2.1/threats/export` (no extra params required) |
| List sites / accounts / groups | `GET /web/api/v2.1/{sites,accounts,groups}` |
| Get system info | `GET /web/api/v2.1/system/info` |

**Write / action (POST/PUT/DELETE):**
- Agent actions (isolate, reconnect, uninstall, scan): `POST /web/api/v2.1/agents/actions/<action>`
- Threat actions (mitigate, verdict, fetch-file): `POST /web/api/v2.1/threats/<action>`
- Mutations (notes, exclusions, IOCs, custom rules): POST/PUT/DELETE on the relevant resource path

**Paths that do not exist — never call these:**

These paths return HTTP 404 and have never existed in the v2.1 spec. They are plausible-sounding guesses that are consistently wrong:

| Wrong path | Why you might guess it | Correct alternative |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /web/api/v2.1/agents/ids` | "query agents by IDs" | `GET /web/api/v2.1/agents?ids=<id1>,<id2>` |
| `POST /web/api/v2.1/threats/summary` | "get a threat summary/count" | `GET /web/api/v2.1/threats?countOnly=true` |
| `POST /web/api/v2.1/export/threats` | "export threats" | `GET /web/api/v2.1/threats/export` |
| `POST /web/api/v2.1/threats/count` | "count threats via POST" | `GET /web/api/v2.1/threats?countOnly=true` |
| `POST /web/api/v2.1/agents/summary` | "agent summary" | `GET /web/api/v2.1/agents/count` + `GET /web/api/v2.1/agents` |

If you are about to call `s1_api_post` for a read/count/export operation, stop and switch to `s1_api_get`. Before any `s1_api_post` call, confirm the path exists: `python3 scripts/search_endpoints.py "<keyword>"` — if the path does not appear, it does not exist.

## Schema gotchas — confirmed on live tenant

These are fields where the obvious guess is wrong. All verified against the live tenant.

### Custom Detection Rules and STAR Rules — POST /cloud-detection/rules

**STAR rules** ("streaming threat assessment rules") are the product name for real-time
detection rules that evaluate every matching event as it arrives. There is no separate
`/star-rules` API path — that path returns 404. STAR rules are `cloud-detection/rules`
with `queryType=events`, the same endpoint as all other Custom Detection Rules.

`queryType` enum (from swagger): `events`, `scheduled`, `correlation`, `uebafirstseen`.

---

#### ⚠️ LISTING DETECTION RULES — read this BEFORE calling GET /cloud-detection/rules

The list endpoint hides `queryType: "scheduled"` rules by default. **Without `isLegacy=false` in the query string, scheduled rules return 0 results even though they exist and are visible in the console UI.** This is the single most common drift between API output and console reality. There is no error, no warning, no hint — the response simply omits scheduled rules. Re-confirmed against the live API, 2026-05.

**Always pass `isLegacy=false` when listing.** The only time you can omit it is if you are 100% sure you only care about events-type STAR rules and want to filter scheduled rules out.

| Goal | Correct query | Anti-pattern (silently wrong) |
|---|---|---|
| List all detection rules | `GET /cloud-detection/rules?isLegacy=false&limit=200` | `GET /cloud-detection/rules?limit=200` — drops scheduled |
| List only scheduled detections | `GET /cloud-detection/rules?isLegacy=false&queryType=scheduled&limit=200` | `GET /cloud-detection/rules?queryType=scheduled` — returns 0 |
| List only events (STAR) rules | `GET /cloud-detection/rules?queryType=events&limit=200` | (this one is safe; events rules are not gated by `isLegacy`) |
| Search by name across all types | `GET /cloud-detection/rules?isLegacy=false&name__contains=Foo` | `GET /cloud-detection/rules?name__contains=Foo` — drops scheduled |

**Verdict-language note for analysts:** if you query without `isLegacy=false` and the response is empty, the correct statement is "no events rules came back; I haven't yet checked scheduled rules" — not "this tenant has zero scheduled detections". Promoting the absence of evidence to "confirmed zero" is the failure mode this gotcha exists to prevent.

`queryType` accepts a single value or an array (comma-separated): `queryType=scheduled` or `queryType=events,scheduled` both work. The combination `queryType=<x>` + `nameSubstring=<y>` returns HTTP 500; use one filter at a time, or use `name__contains` instead of `nameSubstring` (which works with both).

---

**⚠️ Pick the right `queryType` for your rule body BEFORE composing the POST. Mismatches return HTTP 400.**

| Rule body language | Correct `queryType` | Correct `queryLang` | Field carrying the query |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PowerQuery (pipe syntax `\|`)** | **`scheduled`** | **`"2.0"`** | `data.scheduledParams.query` |
| S1QL log-search / event search | `events` | `"1.0"` (default, omit) | `data.s1ql` |
| EUEBA first-seen | `uebafirstseen` | n/a | per swagger schema |
| Correlation | `correlation` | n/a | per swagger schema |

**Any time the rule body has the pipe character `\|` (i.e. PowerQuery), the only working path is `queryType: "scheduled"` + `queryLang: "2.0"`.** `queryType: "events"` rejects pipe syntax (HTTP 400 `Don't understand [|]`), and `queryLang: "2.1"` is not in the enum (HTTP 400 `queryLang: "2.1" is not a valid choice`). Confirmed against the live API, 2026-05.

See the **PowerQuery Scheduled Detections** subsection below for the full scheduled-rule body, gotchas, and the feature-flag fallback path if the tenant has not enabled Scheduled Detections.

`expirationMode` valid values: `"Permanent"` or `"Temporary"`. `"Never"` is not valid and returns 400.

**Events (STAR) rule — confirmed CREATE body (live API, 2026-05):**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "my-star-rule",
    "description": "optional",
    "severity": "Low",
    "expirationMode": "Permanent",
    "queryType": "events",
    "status": "Draft",
    "s1ql": "EventType = \"Process Creation\" AND ProcessName = \"suspicious.exe\"",
    "treatAsThreat": "UNDEFINED",
    "networkQuarantine": false
  },
  "filter": {"siteIds": ["<siteId>"]}
}
```

Events rule gotchas confirmed against live API:
- `"activeResponse"` in the body returns HTTP 400 "Unknown field" — omit it.
- `queryLang` defaults to `"1.0"` for events rules; do not set it explicitly (unlike scheduled rules which require `"2.0"`).
- `treatAsThreat="UNDEFINED"` is accepted on input but stored as `null` in the response.
- `status="Draft"` creates a rule that never fires even if live telemetry matches.
- GET `nameSubstring` + `queryType` combined returns HTTP 500 — use one filter at a time.
- DELETE body is top-level `{filter: {ids: [...], siteIds: [...]}}` with no `"data"` wrapper.
- `isLegacy=false` is NOT needed for events rules (only required for scheduled rules).

`status` valid values: `"Draft"`, `"Activating"`, `"Active"`, `"Disabling"`, `"Disabled"`. Use `"Disabled"` to create a non-firing rule; the API returns `"Draft"` in the response for a rule that has never been activated.

**PUT /cloud-detection/rules/{id}** — `status` is required in the PUT body even though it is read-only in practice. Omitting it returns 400 "Missing data for required field."

### Saved Filters — POST /filters

The body field for filter criteria is `filterFields`, not `filters`:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "my-filter",
    "filterFields": {"infected": true, "networkStatuses": ["connected"]}
  },
  "filter": {"accountIds": ["<accountId>"]}
}
```

**PUT /filters/{id}** — does NOT accept a top-level `filter` scope wrapper. Pass only `{"data": {...}}`:

```json
{"data": {"name": "updated-name", "filterFields": {"infected": false}}}
```

### PowerQuery Scheduled Detections — POST/PUT/GET/DELETE /cloud-detection/rules

`queryType: "scheduled"` rules are PowerQuery-based detections. **This is the only path that accepts pipe-syntax PowerQuery in a detection rule body.** Events rules reject pipe syntax even with `queryLang: "2.0"`. They use a different schema from `events` and `correlation` rules and have several non-obvious requirements confirmed against the live API (2026-05).

**If the POST fails with a feature-not-enabled / not-licensed / unauthorized response on a tenant where the schema is otherwise correct, stop and tell the user to enable the Scheduled Detections feature on the tenant before retrying.** Do not silently downgrade the rule body to S1QL or re-attempt with `queryType: "events"`. The console path is typically *Settings → Account → Detection / SDL Add-Ons → Scheduled Detections* but varies by platform version, so phrase the ask in terms of capability ("please enable Scheduled Detections on this account") rather than the exact click path.

**CREATE — POST /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules**

All five `data` fields are required. `queryLang: "2.0"` is mandatory; omitting it returns HTTP 400 "query lang must be 2.0". `filter` accepts `accountIds` or `siteIds` (account-level rules cover all sites under that account):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "My Scheduled Detection",
    "queryType": "scheduled",
    "queryLang": "2.0",
    "severity": "Medium",
    "expirationMode": "Permanent",
    "status": "Disabled",
    "scheduledParams": {
      "query": "dataSource.name='Proofpoint' event.type='Click' unmapped.classification='malware' | group hits=count(), first_seen=oldest(timestamp), last_seen=newest(timestamp) by clickIP | filter hits >= 1 | sort -hits | limit 100",
      "runIntervalMinutes": 60,
      "lookbackWindowMinutes": 60,
      "threshold": {"value": 0, "operator": "Greater"}
    }
  },
  "filter": {"accountIds": ["<accountId>"]}
}
```

**Scheduled-rule gotchas confirmed against live API (2026-05):**

- `disableAgentMitigation` is **not** part of the scheduled schema. Including it returns HTTP 400 `Unknown field`. Cloud-source PQ rules do not need it; mitigation actions are not supported on scheduled rules anyway.
- `treatAsThreat: "Malicious"` is for events rules with EDR telemetry. Scheduled rules accept `treatAsThreat: "UNDEFINED"` (or omit) and `networkQuarantine: false`. The verdict surfaces via the rule's `severity`, not via mitigation.
- New rules are created in `Draft` status regardless of the requested `status` in the POST. To enable, call `PUT /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules/enable` with `{"filter": {"ids": [...], "accountIds": [...]}}` after creation. The response transitions to `Activating` and then `Active` within the hour.
- The PowerQuery in `scheduledParams.query` must NOT use `nolimit`, `compare`, or subqueries. The 1,000-row intermediate cap from `references/detection-rules.md` applies.

**GET requires `isLegacy=false`** — without this query parameter, the list endpoint returns 0 results for scheduled rules even though they exist and are visible in the console UI. Always include it. **When listing all rules regardless of type (e.g. searching by name), always pass `isLegacy=false` — without it you will only see events-type rules and silently miss all scheduled rules:**

```
GET /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules?isLegacy=false&limit=100
GET /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules?siteIds=<id>&queryType=scheduled&isLegacy=false
GET /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules?ids=<ruleId>&siteIds=<id>&isLegacy=false
```

Note: `name__contains` filter silently returns 0 for scheduled rules when `isLegacy=false` is omitted. Always pair name searches with `isLegacy=false`.

**PUT requires `filter.siteIds`** in the body even though swagger marks `filter` as optional. Also requires all five data fields (name, queryType, severity, expirationMode, status). Additional PUT gotchas confirmed 2026-05-26:

- `activeResponse` in the PUT body returns HTTP 400 "Unknown field" — omit it (same as POST).
- `treatAsThreat: null` in the PUT body returns HTTP 400 "Field may not be null" — use `"UNDEFINED"` even though the GET response shows `null`. The API stores it as `null` but rejects `null` as input.
- `status` must be included (e.g. `"Active"`) even though it is effectively read-only on PUT.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "...", "queryType": "scheduled", "queryLang": "2.0",
    "severity": "High", "expirationMode": "Permanent", "status": "Active",
    "networkQuarantine": false, "treatAsThreat": "UNDEFINED",
    "scheduledParams": {...}
  },
  "filter": {"siteIds": ["<siteId>"]}
}
```

**ENABLE/DISABLE** — dedicated PUT endpoints, both require `ids` and `siteIds` in filter:

```
PUT /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules/enable   body: {"filter": {"ids": ["<ruleId>"], "siteIds": ["<siteId>"]}}
PUT /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules/disable  body: {"filter": {"ids": ["<ruleId>"], "siteIds": ["<siteId>"]}}
```

**DELETE body — use `json_body=` keyword arg in s1_client.py.** The method signature is `delete(path, params=None, json_body=None)`. Passing the filter dict positionally sends it as query params and returns HTTP 400:

```python
# Correct
client.delete("/web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules",
    json_body={"filter": {"ids": [rule_id], "accountIds": [acct_id]}})

# Wrong — sends filter as query string
client.delete("/web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules",
    {"filter": {"ids": [rule_id], "accountIds": [acct_id]}})
```

**Verify deletion with GET (expect 0 hits), not a second DELETE.** A second DELETE returns HTTP 400 "Could not find rule with id: ..." rather than `affected: 0`.

### Alert notes — UAM GraphQL

`deleteAlertNote` has a 30–90 second propagation window after creation before it can be deleted. The mutation uses `alertNoteId`, not `noteId`:

```graphql
mutation del($nid: ID!) {
  deleteAlertNote(alertNoteId: $nid) { data { id } }
}
```

If you call this immediately after creating a note you will get "Alert Note with ID ... does not have mgmt_note_id set". Retry with backoff; the `unified_alerts.delete_alert_note()` helper does this automatically.

## Probing a new tenant

When starting on an unfamiliar tenant, run the non-destructive smoke test once:

```
python scripts/smoke_test_queries.py --workers 12
```

It enumerates every GET plus a curated allow-list of read-only query POSTs, records which ones return 200/403/404/etc., and writes `references/tenant_capabilities.md` and `.json`. Useful for "what's this token actually allowed to do" and as a pre-sales capability snapshot. The sweep is read-only — no writes, no agent actions — so tenant start-state and end-state are identical.

## Files in this skill

- `<project folder>/credentials.json` — credentials (set `S1_CONSOLE_URL` and `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`; see Setup above). Auto-discovered by the MCP server's credential resolver.
- `scripts/bootstrap_creds.sh` — idempotent helper that copies workspace creds into the sandbox-local path. Wired to the MCP server's credential resolver; safe to re-run manually.
- `scripts/s1_client.py` — importable Python client. Handles auth, pooled HTTP connections, retries on 429/5xx, pagination, parallel fan-out via `get_many()`, and optional short-TTL response caching for rarely-changing reads (accounts, sites, groups, system/info, etc.).
- `scripts/call_endpoint.py` — CLI for one-shot calls: `python scripts/call_endpoint.py GET /web/api/v2.1/agents --param limit=5`.
- `scripts/search_endpoints.py` — ranked keyword search over the endpoint index, with synonym expansion and an `--only-works` filter that restricts to endpoints confirmed reachable on this tenant.
- `scripts/smoke_test_queries.py` — non-destructive sweep of every GET + safe query POST. Writes `references/tenant_capabilities.{json,md}`. Read-only; tenant state unchanged.
- `scripts/purple_ai.py` — Purple AI natural-language wrapper over `POST /web/api/v2.1/graphql`. **Non-functional for API tokens** — `purpleLaunchQuery NATURAL_LANGUAGE` requires a browser-session teamToken that service accounts never obtain (confirmed SERVICE_ERROR 2026-05-03). Use the Purple MCP (`mcp__purple-mcp__purple_ai`) for NL queries. Kept for reference only.
- `scripts/call_purple.py` — CLI wrapper for `purple_query()`. **Non-functional for API tokens** (same teamToken constraint). Use the Purple MCP instead.
- `scripts/unified_alerts.py` — Unified Alert Management (UAM) GraphQL wrapper over `POST /web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql`. Covers the full query + mutation surface (list/filter/group/notes/history/trigger-actions). See `references/UNIFIED_ALERTS.md`.
- `scripts/call_unified_alerts.py` — CLI for UAM: `python scripts/call_unified_alerts.py list --filter detectionProduct=EDR --first 10`, `... add-note <id> "…"`, `... set-status --scope <acct> --alert-id <id> RESOLVED`.
- `references/UNIFIED_ALERTS.md` — UAM reference: operation catalogue, schema quirks, filter patterns, action catalogue, worked recipes.
- `references/TAG_INDEX.md` — table of all 113 tags with file pointers and op counts. Start here when you don't know which tag owns an endpoint.
- `references/CAPABILITY_MAP.md` — per-tag verb-and-resource summary (L=list, G=get-one, C=count, E=export, A=action, F=filter, S=search, X=mutate) plus an "I want to…" quick lookup. Your fastest orientation when you know the verb but not the path.
- `references/WORKFLOWS.md` — ready-to-adapt multi-step recipes: threat triage, endpoint isolation, DV / PowerQuery hunt, RemoteOps, audit trail, tenant capability snapshot, etc. Each lists the endpoints you actually need and the params that matter.
- `references/tenant_capabilities.{json,md}` — auto-generated by `smoke_test_queries.py`: per-endpoint status (200/403/404/etc.) for the configured tenant. Regenerate whenever the token or tenant changes. The committed copy is a worked example from the Purple demo tenant.
- `references/endpoint_index.json` — compact machine-readable index (one entry per op). Used by `search_endpoints.py` but can be read directly if you need to filter programmatically.
- `references/tags/<Tag>.md` — per-tag reference with parameters, descriptions, and required permissions. Load only the files you need.
- `references/common_params.md` — shared query params (`skip`, `limit`, `cursor`, `sortBy`, etc.) and the pagination pattern.
- `references/POWERQUERY_RECIPES.md` — PowerQuery / SDL query recipes tested on-tenant: indicator prevalence, PowerShell outbound to public IPs, failed-login triage, storyline activity summary, UAM-indicator SDL crosscheck, endpoint heartbeat. For full PQ language reference use the dedicated `sentinelone-powerquery` skill.
- `spec/swagger_2_1.json` — the original full Swagger spec (14 MB). Use only when the per-tag reference is insufficient — e.g. to resolve a deeply nested request-body schema by `$ref`. Never read this whole file into context.
- `tests/test_ioc_lifecycle.py` — reversible CREATE → LIST → DELETE → VERIFY round-trip for Threat Intelligence IOCs. Uses a unique run-tag per invocation, scopes to a single account, and cleans up before exit. Covers the one "create content" path against the S1 detection surface.
- `tests/test_alerts_dual_api.py` — dual-API round-trip for alerts: GraphQL list/detail/addNote/notes/deleteNote plus a parallel REST `/cloud-detection/alerts` read. Demonstrates that UAM GraphQL is the PRIMARY alert surface and REST is SECONDARY, with the note mutation cleaned up before exit (handles the `mgmt_note_id` propagation delay).
- `scripts/pq.py` — foolproof PowerQuery runner over the LRQ API. Wraps launch/poll/cancel, auth flip to `Bearer`, `X-Dataset-Query-Forward-Tag` capture, exponential backoff on 5xx/429/connection errors, and a best-effort cancel. One call: `run_pq(client, "<query>", hours=24)` returns `{row_count, columns, rows, matchCount, ...}`. Also exposes `list_data_sources(client, hours=24)` for the first-response "does this data source actually exist on this tenant?" check. Use this any time a user says "query logs", "run a PQ", "search for events" via the mgmt console API.
- `scripts/inspect_source.py` — source-agnostic schema discovery. For any `dataSource.name`, samples raw events via the LRQ `LOG` queryType (or sync `/sdl/api/query` when available) and classifies every attribute the parser emits into `principal_user` / `principal_host` / `principal_ip` / `action` / `temporal` / `network` / `file` / `process` / `grouping_candidate` / `other`. Picks `prim_key` + `action_key` from whatever the source actually carries, so downstream code never hardcodes field names. Exports `discover_schema(client, source, hours, sample, extra_filter, backend, escalate)` and `pick_keys(schema)`; CLI: `python scripts/inspect_source.py --source "<name>" --window 24h`. See "Data source + schema discovery" below.
- `scripts/uam_alert_interface.py` — UAM (Unified Alert Management) Alert Interface client for pushing OCSF indicators + alerts INTO UAM via `POST /v1/indicators` and `POST /v1/alerts` on the SentinelOne HEC ingest host (e.g. `ingest.us1.sentinelone.net`, the same host used for log ingest). Handles the gzip-compressed concatenated-JSON body, `Bearer` auth (the endpoint rejects `ApiToken`), and the `S1-Scope` header. Exposes `UAMAlertInterfaceClient`, plus `build_file_indicator()`, `build_process_indicator()`, `build_network_indicator()`, and `build_alert_referencing()` payload helpers. URL defaults to `https://ingest.us1.sentinelone.net`; override via the `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` env var or credentials.json key (former canonical `S1_UAM_ALERT_INTERFACE_URL` and legacy snake_case `uam_alert_interface_url` still honored).
- `tests/test_uam_alert_interface_single.py` — minimum-viable reversible write-side round-trip: POST one OCSF FileSystem-Activity indicator + one SecurityAlert referencing it, poll UAM GraphQL until the alert surfaces, verify the indicator is stitched in, then close the alert via bulk-ops (status=RESOLVED, analystVerdict=TRUE_POSITIVE_BENIGN). Covers the single-indicator happy path into UAM.
- `tests/test_uam_alert_interface_batch.py` — comprehensive reversible round-trip: batched POST of 3 indicators (OCSF classes 1001 FileSystem Activity, 1007 Process Activity, 4001 Network Activity) each carrying 3+ observables, referenced by a single SecurityAlert via `finding_info.related_events[]`. Verifies all 3 metadata.uids and their observable names surface in `alert.rawIndicators`, then closes the alert. Covers batching, multi-observable, and multi-indicator linkage.
- `scripts/ingestion_gateway.py` + `tests/test_ingestion_gateway_alert_with_indicator.py` — deprecated back-compat shims. The helper re-exports from `uam_alert_interface`; the test prints a pointer to the renamed file and exits non-zero.
- `scripts/build_source_report.py`: collector for the CTO report pipeline. Runs dimension probes + per-principal mix + timeline for a named data source via `scripts/pq.py` and writes `reports/<slug>_<window>/data.json`. Outputs to a per-source subfolder so multiple sources and windows coexist cleanly.
- `scripts/render_charts.py`: pure-function renderer. `data.json` in, PNG charts out under `reports/<slug>_<window>/charts/`. No tenant calls.
- `scripts/build_docx.py` / `scripts/build_pptx.py`: source-agnostic renderers that read `data.json` and emit `<Slug>_CTO_Report_<window>.docx` and `<Slug>_CTO_Deck_<window>.pptx`. Every section is gated on `dims` so dimension-sparse sources render cleanly. See "CTO report generation pipeline" below for the full contract and renderer gotchas.
- `reports/<slug>_<window>/`: per-run artefact directory. Holds `data.json`, `charts/`, and the rendered `.docx` / `.pptx`. Treat this as the portable unit: move or archive the whole folder.

## Using the client in Python

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")  # or set PYTHONPATH
from s1_client import S1Client, S1APIError

c = S1Client(cache_ttl=60)   # optional 60s cache for accounts/sites/groups/system-info

# single page
r = c.get("/web/api/v2.1/threats", params={"limit": 100, "resolved": False})

# full iteration
for threat in c.iter_items("/web/api/v2.1/threats", params={"limit": 200}):
    ...

# parallel fan-out — independent GETs over pooled connections (~3× faster)
results = c.get_many([
    ("/web/api/v2.1/accounts", {"limit": 1}),
    ("/web/api/v2.1/sites",    {"limit": 1}),
    ("/web/api/v2.1/groups",   {"limit": 1}),
    ("/web/api/v2.1/system/info", None),
], max_workers=8)
# -> [{"path":..., "ok":True, "status":200, "data":..., "elapsed_ms":...}, ...]

# action endpoint
c.post("/web/api/v2.1/agents/actions/disconnect", json_body={"filter": {"ids": ["AGENT_ID"]}})
```

## Authentication

The API uses header auth: `Authorization: ApiToken <token>`. The client injects this automatically — do not hand-roll headers.

Token scopes are enforced server-side. Each endpoint in the per-tag references lists `Required permissions` — if a 403 comes back, the token lacks one of those scopes, and the fix is a new token (not a code change). Surface this clearly to the user.

## Rate limits and retries

The client retries automatically on 429 and 5xx with exponential backoff (max 30s), honoring `Retry-After` when present. For bulk operations across thousands of entities, prefer a single filtered action endpoint (`/agents/actions/...`) over a loop of per-ID calls — the API is designed around filter-based bulk ops.

## Destructive actions — confirm first

Many endpoints are destructive or operationally sensitive: disconnect/reconnect agent, uninstall, isolate, shutdown, decommission, script execution via RemoteOps, policy changes, user mutations, account/site deletion. Before firing any `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` that affects agents, policies, or tenant config, summarize exactly what will happen (endpoint, filter, estimated scope) and get explicit user confirmation. A 200 response on a wrong filter can isolate thousands of endpoints — there is no undo on many of these.

The safe pattern: run the matching `GET` with `countOnly=true` first to show the blast radius, then the mutating call.

## Purple AI — natural-language query, alert summary, and auto-investigation

> **Precedence:** if the user explicitly mentions "purple mcp" or "mcp", prefer the Purple MCP tools (`mcp__purple-mcp__purple_ai`, `mcp__purple-mcp__powerquery`, etc.) — this skill is the backup path in that case. Use the wrapper below when the user has asked for the S1 console/API directly, when Purple MCP is unavailable, or when you need to script a raw GraphQL call.

### Hosts

| Host | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<region>.sentinelone.net` | Management console — all REST and GraphQL calls use this host |
| `id.na1.sentinelone.net` | Browser session keep-alive (not relevant for API tokens) |
| `metrics-proxy-use1.na1.sentinelone.net` | Internal metrics (returned 503 in observed sessions, non-fatal) |

### Endpoints

Purple AI uses **three** GraphQL endpoints (all traffic is `POST` with JSON body). Each request carries `?opname=<OperationName>&requestId=<uuid>` as query-string params for tracing; the server only inspects the JSON body.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /web/api/v2.1/graphql` | LLM dispatcher — `purpleLaunchQuery`, `purpleAlertSummary` |
| `POST /sdl/v2/graphql` | Notebook lifecycle + SDL query execution (see operation table below) |
| `POST /web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql` | UAM — auto-investigation trigger and polling |

Auth uses the same `Authorization: ApiToken <token>` header as REST. No extra credential setup.

### SDL operation table (`POST /sdl/v2/graphql`)

| opname | Triggered by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `notebooks` | Sidebar load | List My Notebooks / Shared Notebooks |
| `createNotebook` | "+ New Notebook" or starter prompt | Creates a notebook; response includes `teamToken` |
| `purpleNotebook` | Selecting a notebook | Loads full Q&A history for the notebook |
| `addPurpleInputOutputMessage` | After each LLM/query step | Persists user prompt + AI output into the notebook |
| `launchQuery` | After LLM produces a PowerQuery | Executes the PQ against the data lake |
| `pingQuery` | Repeatedly while query runs | Short-poll for status/progress/results |
| `removeQuery` | On completion or cancel | Cleans up the query and releases resources |

### Bootstrap REST calls (browser-only)

These fire on page load and when entering a notebook. Not needed for API-token workflows, but useful for debugging feature availability:

- `GET /web/api/v2.1/private/system/enabled-features?siteIds=<id>` — feature flags (`purpleNative`, `purpleConversations`, `purpleAutoInvestigations`)
- `GET /web/api/v2.1/private/rbac/user-permissions?siteIds=<id>` — current user's permission set
- `POST /web/api/v2.1/private/users/session-info` — session info

### Operations

#### purpleLaunchQuery — NL → PowerQuery (or summary/suggestions)

**Critical: this is a GraphQL `query` (not `mutation`). Variable wrapper is `request` (type `PurpleLaunchQueryRequest`). Prior implementations using `mutation` + `PurpleLaunchQueryInput` fail with HTTP 400.**

`contentType` controls what the LLM is asked to do:

| contentType | Returns |
|---|---|
| `NATURAL_LANGUAGE` | `result.powerQuery.query` — the generated PQ string |
| `QUERY_RESULTS` | `result.summary` — English summary of a previous PQ result set |
| `SUGGEST_QUESTIONS` | `result.suggestedQuestions[]` — follow-up question chips |
| `STAR_RULE`, `DETECTION_RULE` | `result.detectionRule` — generated detection logic |

```graphql
query purpleLaunchQuery($request: PurpleLaunchQueryRequest!) {
  purpleLaunchQuery(request: $request) {
    token
    resultType
    status { state error { errorType errorDetail origin } }
    stepsCompleted
    result {
      message
      summary
      maskedMetadata
      powerQuery { query viewSelector timeRange { start end } }
      suggestedQuestions { question powerQuery viewSelector timeRange { start end } }
    }
  }
}
```

Variables (`$request`):
```jsonc
{
  "request": {
    "isAsync": false,
    "contentType": "NATURAL_LANGUAGE",
    "consoleDetails": { "baseUrl": "https://<region>.sentinelone.net/", "version": "S-26.1.3#69" },
    // TOP-LEVEL inputContent required (confirmed: HTTP 400 "missing input value at $request.inputContent" without it)
    "inputContent": {
      "userInput": "<the user's question>",
      "viewSelector": "EDR",
      "displayedTimeRange": { "start": <epochMs>, "end": <epochMs> },
      "resultsPq": null, "powerQueryForResults": null, "contextId": null, "userDetails": null
    },
    "conversation": {
      "id": "<uuid>",
      "messages": [{
        "inputMessage": {
          "id": "<uuid>", "feedItemId": "<32hex>", "conversationId": "<uuid>",
          "createdAt": "<iso>", "messageType": "INPUT", "contentType": "NATURAL_LANGUAGE",
          "inputContent": {
            "userInput": "<the user's question>",
            "viewSelector": "EDR",
            "displayedTimeRange": { "start": <epochMs>, "end": <epochMs> },
            "resultsPq": null, "powerQueryForResults": null, "contextId": null, "userDetails": null
          }
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

`PurpleUserDetailsRequest` schema (confirmed via live validation error — does NOT have `siteIds` or `groupIds`):
```jsonc
{
  "accountId": "<19-digit ID>",  // ID! required
  "teamToken": "<24-char>",      // ID! required — session token from Purple AI workspace
  "sessionId": "<uuid>",
  "emailAddress": "<user@...>",
  "userAgent": "<browser UA>",
  "buildDate": "<iso>",
  "buildHash": "<short hash>"
}
```

Full end-to-end flow for one user question (observed in browser session):
```
1. purpleLaunchQuery  (NATURAL_LANGUAGE, /web/api/v2.1/graphql)
   → result.powerQuery.query  (the generated PQ string)

2. addPurpleInputOutputMessage  (/sdl/v2/graphql)
   → persists user prompt + generated PQ into the notebook

3. launchQuery  (/sdl/v2/graphql)
   → submits PQ to SDL execution engine
   → returns { token, ids, status: RUNNING }

4. pingQuery × N  (/sdl/v2/graphql, ~1 Hz)
   → polls until status = COMPLETED
   → returns columns + cells (table data)

5. purpleLaunchQuery  (QUERY_RESULTS, /web/api/v2.1/graphql)
   → result.summary  (English summary of the rows)

6. purpleLaunchQuery  (SUGGEST_QUESTIONS, /web/api/v2.1/graphql)
   → result.suggestedQuestions[]  (follow-up chips)

7. addPurpleInputOutputMessage  (/sdl/v2/graphql)
   → persists the final answer into the notebook

8. removeQuery  (/sdl/v2/graphql)
   → cleanup / releases query budget
```

Starter-prompt flow (e.g. "Find install logs" on the homepage):
```
createNotebook → purpleLaunchQuery (NATURAL_LANGUAGE) → addPurpleInputOutputMessage
```
Note: starter prompts that return a documentation-style answer skip the `launchQuery`/`pingQuery` stage entirely.

**API-token users: use the Purple MCP.** The `purple_ai_query` MCP tool has been removed — `purpleLaunchQuery NATURAL_LANGUAGE` is confirmed non-functional for service-account API tokens (requires browser-session teamToken; returns AsimovError from LaunchQueryManager). Use `mcp__purple-mcp__purple_ai` for NL queries and `mcp__purple-mcp__powerquery` to execute the returned PQ.

#### purpleAlertSummary — per-alert natural-language summary

Separate operation (not purpleLaunchQuery). Synchronous (isAsync=false, no polling).

```graphql
query AlertSummary($request: PurpleAlertSummaryRequest!) {
  purpleAlertSummary(request: $request) {
    token
    result { summary }
  }
}
```

Variables: `request.contentType = "ALERT_ENTRY"`, `request.inputAlert = "<OCSF alert JSON as string>"`, `request.consoleDetails`, `request.userDetails`.

**MCP tool:** `purple_ai_alert_summary` — call `uam_get_alert` first to get the OCSF JSON, then pass it here.

#### aiInvestigations — auto-investigation

Two-step flow, both via the UAM GraphQL endpoint (`/web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql`):

1. `alertTriggerActions` mutation with `id: "S1/aiInvestigation/run"` — fires investigation
2. `GetAlertAiInvestigations` query, polled every ~4s — streams `investigationStep` text, final `result` (markdown, ~16KB) + `verdict` enum

Verdict enum: `UNKNOWN`, `TRUE_POSITIVE`, `FALSE_POSITIVE`.

**API-token users: use the Purple MCP.** The `purple_ai_investigate` MCP tool has been removed — `aiInvestigation/run` via `alertTriggerActions` is confirmed non-functional for service-account API tokens (returns SERVICE_ERROR; same teamToken dependency as `purpleLaunchQuery`). Use `mcp__purple-mcp__purple_ai` for AI investigations.

### Python CLI

> **`purple_query()` and `scripts/call_purple.py` are non-functional for API tokens.** Both call `purpleLaunchQuery NATURAL_LANGUAGE`, which requires a browser-session teamToken that service accounts never have (confirmed SERVICE_ERROR 2026-05-03). Use the Purple MCP instead:
>
> ```
> mcp__purple-mcp__purple_ai   # natural-language query → PQ → result
> mcp__purple-mcp__powerquery  # run a PQ string directly
> ```
>
> `scripts/purple_ai.py` and `scripts/call_purple.py` are kept in the skill for reference but will fail with AsimovError on any service-account token.

### Domain boundary

Purple AI answers questions about **SDL telemetry** (process/network/file events, indicators, ingested logs). It does **not** answer questions about **console entities** (alerts, threats, agents, sites, policies). Those are REST resources. Out-of-domain questions return `resultType: "MESSAGE"` with a guardrail refusal — switch to the REST path.

### Caveats and confirmed API-token limitations (live-tested 2026-05-03)

| Operation | API-token result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `purpleAlertSummary` (ALERT_ENTRY) | **PASS** — returns real LLM summary | Works with `userDetails: null`; no SDL dependency |
| `purpleLaunchQuery` (NATURAL_LANGUAGE) | **FAIL** — `AsimovError` from `LaunchQueryManager` | LLM layer rejects service-account requests; see below |
| `aiInvestigation/run` via `alertTriggerActions` | **FAIL** — `SERVICE_ERROR` | Same LLM-layer dependency |
| `/sdl/v2/graphql` queries (`purpleConversations`, etc.) | **FAIL** — `unauthenticated` | SDL queries require browser session cookie |
| `/sdl/v2/graphql` mutations (`createNotebook`, etc.) | **PARTIAL** — schema validation reached | Auth passes for mutations; mutation names differ from browser UI (introspection blocked) |

**Root cause of NATURAL_LANGUAGE failures:** `purpleLaunchQuery` internally routes to the same LLM workspace layer as the browser UI. That layer uses `teamToken` (obtained by browser users via `createNotebook` on `/sdl/v2/graphql`) to identify the user's Purple AI notebook. Service accounts (API tokens) never initialize a browser session, so `teamToken` is always empty and the `LaunchQueryManager` (`AsimovError`) rejects the request. This is not a schema issue — the request passes GraphQL validation (HTTP 200) and fails at the LLM dispatch layer.

`purpleAlertSummary` bypasses this because it is a self-contained summarisation operation: the full alert context is supplied inline in `inputAlert`, no SDL session or teamToken lookup is needed.

**SDL auth nuance (confirmed via live testing):** SDL query operations return `unauthenticated` for API tokens. SDL mutations reach schema validation (meaning auth succeeds) — but the specific mutation names used by the browser UI (`createNotebook`, etc.) are not exposed under those names for API tokens. Introspection is blocked on the SDL endpoint.

- The GraphQL endpoint is **not a committed public API**. Field names and schema can change between console releases.
- Notebooks have a TTL — old notebooks return "Notebook is expired" and queries return no results.
- Each GraphQL request should carry a unique `requestId` UUID as a query param for tracing (`?opname=<op>&requestId=<uuid>`). The server ignores it but it aids debugging.
- Permission failures for `purpleLaunchQuery` surface as `status.state = FAILED` with `error.origin = LaunchQueryManager` (HTTP 200, not 400 or 403) — not the usual "invalid query" 400 you get for schema errors.
- Do **not** auto-execute generated PQ without showing it to the user first — Purple can hallucinate fields.
- `inputContent` must appear at **both** the top level of `request` AND inside `conversation.messages[0].inputMessage.inputContent` — the server requires both (confirmed via live validation).

## Querying logs via the mgmt console API — the foolproof procedure

Every time somebody rolls their own `requests.post(...)` for a PowerQuery, one of the same six things goes wrong: wrong auth prefix, wrong endpoint path, missing `tenant: true`, missing `X-Dataset-Query-Forward-Tag`, no retry on transient 5xx, or 0 rows and the wrong debugging reflex. The fix is: do not hand-roll the call. Use `scripts/pq.py`.

### Step 0 — pick the right surface before you write a query

| The user wants… | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Raw event telemetry (EDR, third-party logs, SDL data) | **`scripts/pq.py`** (LRQ PowerQuery) | This is what SDL/PowerQuery is for. All `dataSource.*`, `event.*`, `src.process.*`, `tgt.file.*`, `i.scheme="edr"` filters. |
| Triage/filter/note/status on an existing alert | `scripts/unified_alerts.py` (UAM GraphQL) | Alerts are entities, not log events. UAM filter syntax is GraphQL `FilterInput`, NOT PowerQuery. Do not confuse the two. |
| Legacy STAR/cloud-detection alert REST shape | `/web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/alerts` | Only when you need `agentDetectionInfo` / `sourceProcess` etc. Otherwise UAM. |
| A console entity — threat, agent, site, policy, IOC, group | REST via `s1_client.py` | Not a log query. `GET /web/api/v2.1/{threats,agents,sites,...}`. |
| Natural-language hunt that can be hand-reviewed | `purple_ai.purple_query(...)` then LRQ-execute the returned PQ | Purple generates PQ text; `pq.py` runs it. |

If the user names a vendor ("Prompt Security", "Zscaler", "Okta", "FortiGate") and says "query" or "search logs", that is always the PQ path, never UAM filter syntax.

### Step 1 — use `scripts/pq.py`, not inline `requests`

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from s1_client import S1Client
from pq import run_pq, list_data_sources, PQError

c = S1Client()

# One call. Handles launch, polling, forward-tag, cancel, retry, the lot.
res = run_pq(
    c,
    "dataSource.name = 'Prompt Security' "
    "| group ct = count() by event.type "
    "| sort -ct "
    "| limit 50",
    hours=24,
)
print(res["matchCount"], "events ->", res["row_count"], "rows")
for row in res["rows"]:
    print(row)
```

The helper does ALL of this for you, so there is nothing to remember:

- `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` (flipped from the REST `ApiToken` prefix; same JWT, different scheme).
- `POST /sdl/v2/api/queries` on the tenant console host. **NOT** `/web/api/v2.1/sdl/v2/api/queries`, **NOT** `xdr.us1.sentinelone.net`. Do not "fix" a 404 by adding `/web/api/v2.1` — that path does not exist; the fix is the shorter path.
- Captures `X-Dataset-Query-Forward-Tag` from the POST response and echoes it on every GET / DELETE (mandatory for shard routing; without it you get rejections).
- Sets `queryType: "PQ"`, `tenant: true`, `pq: {query, resultType: "TABLE"}` (omit `tenant` and you silently get `matchCount=0`).
- Polls at 1s (query expires 30s after the last poll — slower polling means you lose the query).
- Retries 5xx / 429 / connection errors with exponential backoff. Honors `Retry-After`. The DNS-cache-overflow 503s behind some egress proxies are exactly what this is for.
- Cancels on every exit path (success, deadline, failure) to release the per-account concurrent-query budget.

### Step 2 — if you get 0 rows, follow the ladder, do NOT widen the window first

`run_pq` returning `row_count=0` has an ordered diagnostic. Burning time by widening the window first is the most common failure mode; the window is almost never the cause.

1. **Enumerate the data sources.** If your filter names a vendor / product, first confirm it exists on THIS tenant and you have the string right. Spelling, case, and punctuation matter — the filter is a literal string match.

   ```python
   sources = list_data_sources(c, hours=24)
   for s in sources[:30]:
       print(s["dataSource.name"], s["dataSource.category"], s["ct"])
   ```

   If "Prompt Security" isn't in the list, the tenant isn't ingesting it — no amount of widening the window will help. If it's there under a different spelling (`"PromptSecurity"`, `"Prompt Sec"`), use the exact string.
2. **Compare `matchCount` vs `row_count`.** `matchCount=0` means the initial filter discarded everything before any aggregation — the filter is too tight (or naming the wrong thing). `matchCount > 0` with `row_count = 0` means a post-pipe stage (`| group`, `| filter after group`) ate the rows — inspect the pipe.
3. **Only after the above come back clean**, widen the time window — in that order: 24h → 7d → 30d.

### Step 3 — for large windows / heavy aggregates, slice

For ranges past 2-3 days with `event.type=*`-scale aggregates, slice the window and run slices in parallel. Full reference, measured perf (30d 574M-event aggregate lands in ~29s with two service-user JWTs), and the two-JWT runner recipe are in the `sentinelone-powerquery` skill at `references/lrq-api.md`. `run_pq` is the single-slice primitive underneath.

### Step 3a — timeseries: prefer client-side day slicing over `timebucket(...)`

`timebucket(...)` works in PQ when used as a NAMED grouping output inside `group ... by`:

```
| group n = count() by day = timebucket('1d'), action     ← works
```

The bare positional form (no alias) and references inside `let` / `filter` are unreliable across tenant versions and have historically returned HTTP 500 `"undefined field 'timebucket'"`. Even when `timebucket` does work, a single 7d / 30d aggregate against a busy source frequently exceeds the LRQ per-call deadline (~38s observed) — a 7d aggregate that finishes in 60s on the older `/api/powerQuery` endpoint will time out on LRQ.

**Default to client-side day slicing for any window > 24h.** It's faster, avoids the deadline budget, respects the per-user 3 rps cap cleanly, and produces the same end result. The named-form `day = timebucket('1d')` is fine inside a single 24h-or-less slice when you really do need per-hour or per-15-min buckets:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
import concurrent.futures as cf

def slice_day(c, base, start, end):
    iso = lambda t: t.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    return run_pq(c, base + " | group n=count() by action | sort -n",
                  start_time=iso(start), end_time=iso(end),
                  poll_deadline_s=90)

end = datetime.now(timezone.utc).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
days = [(end - timedelta(days=i+1), end - timedelta(days=i)) for i in range(7)]
with cf.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as ex:   # 3rps user cap
    results = list(ex.map(lambda se: slice_day(c, base, *se), days))
```

7 daily slices run in ~20s wall-clock (vs ~2 min for a 7d aggregate) and respect the per-user 3 rps cap. For hourly buckets over a 24h window use 24 slices at the same concurrency; for 30d use hourly slicing with 2 JWTs (see `sentinelone-powerquery` skill).

### Step 3b — window-scaling playbook (performance by period)

| Window | Recommended runner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| seconds to 1h | single `run_pq(hours=1)` | server returns in <5s |
| 1h to 24h | single `run_pq(hours=24)` | 5-30s depending on filter selectivity |
| 24h to 7d | single call OK for selective filters; for `event.type=*`-scale aggregates, 7 x 1d slices in parallel (max_workers=3) | single-call ~2 min; sliced ~20s |
| 7d to 30d | mandatory slicing (daily buckets) + 2 JWTs | two-JWT runner in `sentinelone-powerquery` |
| 30d+ | hourly slicing + 2-3 JWTs, cache results | 574M-event aggregate at 30d = ~29s with two JWTs |

### Step 3c — LRQ response-shape gotchas (handled by `run_pq`)

If you ever have to read a raw LRQ response (e.g. debugging), know:

- `columns` is a list of dicts `{name, cellType, decimalPlaces}`, not a list of strings. Zipping values by `col["name"]` (not `str(col)`) is mandatory.
- `matchCount` lives inside the `data` block (`response["data"]["matchCount"]`), not at top level. Default to that path; fall back to top-level for older engines.
- `values` is an array of arrays (one per row); `run_pq` pairs it with column names for you.

### Step 4 — when NOT to use `pq.py`

- If the user said "purple mcp" or "mcp", defer to `mcp__purple-mcp__powerquery` first; this is the backup path when the MCP times out or 5xxs.
- If the user is working with alerts as entities (listing, filtering, note, status), that's UAM GraphQL (`unified_alerts.py`), not PowerQuery. UAM filter syntax is `[{fieldId, stringEqual: {...}}]`; it is NOT PowerQuery `| filter` syntax. Mixing them is a common trap in screenshot-driven debugging.

### Checklist before running a PQ programmatically

- [ ] You called `run_pq` / `list_data_sources`, not inline `requests.post`.
- [ ] Base URL is the tenant console (e.g. `https://your-tenant.sentinelone.net`), not `xdr.us1.sentinelone.net`.
- [ ] Endpoint path is `/sdl/v2/api/queries` (short form). If you see 404s, do NOT add `/web/api/v2.1` — that's wrong.
- [ ] If you're filtering on EDR data (`src.process.*`, `event.type=*`, `tgt.file.*`), prepend `dataSource.name='SentinelOne' dataSource.category='security'` — on mixed tenants the default scope carries Scalyr/infra logs too and wide filters silently return `matchCount=0`.
- [ ] 0 rows → ran `list_data_sources` and checked `matchCount` vs `row_count` BEFORE widening the window.

## Unified Alert Management (UAM) — PRIMARY alert API

> **Alert API precedence — important:**
> 1. **PRIMARY — GraphQL UAM** at `POST /web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql`. This is the modern, multi-source alerts inbox (EDR, XDR, Identity, STAR, Cloud, NGFW, and ingested third-party telemetry). IDs are UUIDs (e.g. `019db24c-8b6d-7451-8697-b1b2e1a270f1`). Use this for any alert listing, filtering, triage, note, status, verdict, assignment, group-by, facet, or CSV-export task.
> 2. **SECONDARY — REST** at `GET /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/alerts`. Older surface, scoped to cloud-detection events (STAR rule hits, EDR overflow). IDs are int64 (e.g. `2055164731151448891`). Use only when you specifically need the denormalized REST payload (`agentDetectionInfo`, `sourceProcess`, `targetProcess`, `ruleInfo`) or when UAM is unavailable. These are **parallel surfaces, not redundant** — the same alert will have different IDs in each.
> 3. **No `createAlert`.** S1 does not expose a mutation for creating alerts directly. Alerts are server-side byproducts of detection engines — create a STAR/Custom Detection rule (`POST /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules`), upload an IOC that matches live telemetry (`POST /web/api/v2.1/threat-intelligence/iocs`), or generate synthetic endpoint activity. `addAlertNote` is the closest reversible content-creation path against an existing alert.

Auth is the same `Authorization: ApiToken` header as REST; no extra credentials. Full reference in `references/UNIFIED_ALERTS.md`. The end-to-end dual-API round-trip test is `tests/test_alerts_dual_api.py`.

Use UAM whenever the user is working with *alerts* as first-class entities — triaging, filtering, adding notes, resolving, bulk-assigning — rather than the older `GET /web/api/v2.1/threats` surface.

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from s1_client import S1Client
import unified_alerts as uam

c = S1Client()

# discover: fieldIds, enum values, which views have data
cols = uam.column_metadata(c)
avail = uam.view_data_availability(c)

# triage: top 20 NEW CRITICAL EDR alerts from the last day
page = uam.list_alerts(c, filters=[
    uam.build_filter(fieldId="detectionProduct", stringEqual={"value": "EDR"}),
    uam.build_filter(fieldId="status",   stringEqual={"value": "NEW"}),
    uam.build_filter(fieldId="severity", stringEqual={"value": "CRITICAL"}),
], first=20)

# act: bulk resolve a specific list of alerts, with a note
account = uam.scope(["<account_id>"])
uam.set_alert_status(
    c, scope_input=account,
    alert_ids=["<alert1>", "<alert2>"],
    status="RESOLVED",
    note="Auto-closed: part of campaign tracked in JIRA-1234",
)
```

CLI equivalents:

```
python scripts/call_unified_alerts.py list --filter detectionProduct=EDR --first 20
python scripts/call_unified_alerts.py facets status severity detectionProduct
python scripts/call_unified_alerts.py notes <alert-id>
python scripts/call_unified_alerts.py add-note <alert-id> "Investigating"
python scripts/call_unified_alerts.py set-status --scope <account-id> --alert-id <id1> <id2> RESOLVED --note "..."
python scripts/call_unified_alerts.py csv-export --filter severity=CRITICAL -o crit.csv
```

### UAM domain — what belongs here vs REST

UAM owns everything in the modern Alerts inbox, including alert notes, alert history, mitigation results, trigger-actions, and Cursor-paginated group-by / facet views. The older `/web/api/v2.1/threats` REST surface still exists and covers the classic endpoint-protection threat lifecycle — when the user says "alerts", "unified alerts", "alert notes", or mentions XDR / multi-source detections, route to UAM. When they say "threat", "threat group", "incident", or reference `/threats`, stay on REST.

### Important quirks (hidden by the wrapper, but mind them if writing raw GraphQL)

- The `alerts` query takes a flat `filters: [FilterInput!]` (AND-joined); mutations and `alertAvailableActions` take `filter: OrFilterSelectionInput` shaped as `{ or: [{ and: [FilterInput, ...] }, ...] }`. Mixing these up is a validation error. The wrapper exposes `build_filter(...)`, `or_filter(...)`, and `scope(...)` helpers so callers don't have to hand-assemble them.
- `updateAlertNote` and `deleteAlertNote` fail for ~30–90s after a note is freshly created (`"Alert Note with ID ... does not have mgmt_note_id set, unable to [edit|delete], try again later!"`) because the management-console backend is still propagating an internal id. The wrapper retries automatically with backoff — callers don't need to sleep.
- `aiInvestigations` has no `data` wrapper, but `alertNotes` / `alertFiltersCount` / `alertGroupByCount` / `alertAvailableActions` / `alertMitigationActionResults` / CSV exports all do. `alerts` / `alertHistory` / `alertTimeline` / `alertGroups` use connection shape (`edges`/`pageInfo`/`totalCount`).
- Full list of traps — including the `SortOrderType` enum name, `alertGroupByCount` using `limit` (not `first`), subselection requirements on `CsvResponse` / `ActionsError`, and the actual shape of `alertsViewDataAvailability` — is in `references/UNIFIED_ALERTS.md` under "Schema quirks".

### Destructive actions — blast radius

`alertTriggerActions` is the single mutation that can touch many alerts at once. Passing `filter: null` means *every alert in scope* — potentially hundreds of thousands. The safe pattern is the same as REST bulk actions:

1. Use `list_alerts(..., first=1)` with the proposed filter and read `totalCount`.
2. Show the user the exact filter + action list + count.
3. Only after explicit confirmation, call `trigger_actions(...)` or one of the `set_alert_status` / `set_analyst_verdict` / `assign_alerts` convenience wrappers (all of which constrain the filter to an explicit alert-id list by default).

## UAM Alert Interface (Unified Alert Management) -- pushing OCSF indicators + alerts INTO UAM

Everything else in this skill talks to `<tenant>.sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1/...` (the Mgmt Console) and is read-or-mutate on pre-existing server state. The **UAM Alert Interface** (formerly "Ingestion Gateway") is a separate API family on a separate host for the write-side path: it lets you push OCSF-formatted indicators and alerts INTO UAM so they show up in the console as real alerts with attached indicators. Use it when a user asks to "create an alert", "ingest indicators", "send alerts from my pipeline", or "test alert ingestion".

**Host and wire contract:**

- Prod (US1): `https://ingest.us1.sentinelone.net`. This is the SentinelOne HEC (HTTP Event Collector) ingest host, shared between log ingest and OCSF alert/indicator ingest. Configure via the `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` env var, the `--uam-url` flag, or the `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` key in `credentials.json`. The former canonical `S1_UAM_ALERT_INTERFACE_URL` and legacy snake_case `uam_alert_interface_url` are still honored as fallbacks.
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`. NOT `ApiToken`. The mgmt-console JWT from `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` works; the endpoint rejects `ApiToken ...` with HTTP 401 `"Unsupported auth type"`.
- Body: concatenated JSON (one or more objects back-to-back, optionally newline-separated), gzip-compressed. `Content-Encoding: gzip` is mandatory. zstd also accepted.
- Scope: `S1-Scope: <accountId>` or `<accountId>:<siteId>[:<groupId>]` is mandatory.
- Success shape: `202 Accepted` with `{"details":"Success","status":202}`.

**Endpoints:**

- `POST /v1/indicators` -- raw behavioral indicators. Each must carry `metadata.profiles = ["s1/security_indicator"]` and a unique `metadata.uid` (this is the join key). Batching: send many indicators in one call by passing a list; the client concatenates + gzips.
- `POST /v1/alerts` -- SecurityAlert wrappers. Each references its indicator(s) via `finding_info.related_events[].uid == indicator.metadata.uid`. A single alert can reference multiple indicators (one entry per indicator). The server stitches them into `alert.rawIndicators` / the UAM Indicators tab once both land. **Call with ONE alert per POST.** The wire format accepts multi-alert bodies and the gateway returns HTTP 202, but the stitcher silently drops all but one alert in a multi-alert batch (your-tenant 2026-04-22); loop one at a time, or use `post_alert_with_indicators` which enforces the safe pattern.

**Supported indicator classes (via builders):**

- `build_file_indicator(...)` -- OCSF class 1001 FileSystem Activity. Observables: Hostname, File Name, Hash (SHA-256/MD5), User Name, IP Address.
- `build_process_indicator(...)` -- OCSF class 1007 Process Activity. Observables: Hostname, Process Name, Resource UID (pid), User Name, IP Address, plus parent process.
- `build_network_indicator(...)` -- OCSF class 4001 Network Activity. Observables: Hostname, src/dst IP Address, URL, User Name.

**Python usage:**

```python
import sys, time, uuid
sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from s1_client import S1Client
from uam_alert_interface import (
    UAMAlertInterfaceClient,
    build_file_indicator, build_process_indicator, build_network_indicator,
    build_alert_referencing,
)

mgmt = S1Client()
uam_iface = UAMAlertInterfaceClient(bearer_token=mgmt.api_token)

now_ms = int(time.time() * 1000)
ind_uid_a, ind_uid_b, alert_uid = (str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in range(3))

ind_a = build_file_indicator(
    indicator_uid=ind_uid_a, file_name="payload.iso",
    file_sha256="0"*64, device_uid=str(uuid.uuid4()),
    device_hostname="host-1", device_ip="192.0.2.10",
    user_uid=str(uuid.uuid4()), now_ms=now_ms,
)
ind_b = build_process_indicator(
    indicator_uid=ind_uid_b, process_name="powershell.exe",
    process_pid=4242, process_cmd_line="powershell -enc ...",
    parent_process_name="explorer.exe",
    device_uid=str(uuid.uuid4()), device_hostname="host-1",
    user_uid=str(uuid.uuid4()), now_ms=now_ms,
)
alert = build_alert_referencing(
    alert_uid=alert_uid, indicators=[ind_a, ind_b], now_ms=now_ms,
    title="Ingested alert", description="...",
)

# Preferred safe path. Posts the indicators, sleeps 3s (so each
# metadata.uid registers before the stitcher resolves related_events),
# then posts the single alert. For many alerts, LOOP this call -- do
# NOT pass multiple alerts to post_alerts() in one go (see constraints
# below).
uam_iface.post_alert_with_indicators(
    alert, [ind_a, ind_b], scope=f"{account_id}:{site_id}")
# Then poll UAM GraphQL (unified_alerts.list_alerts) to see it surface.
```

**Validation:** after ingest, find the alert via UAM GraphQL (`unified_alerts.list_alerts` filtered by name, or `get_alert(alert_id)` once you know it). `get_alert_with_raw_indicators(c, alert_id)` returns the raw indicator dict(s) so you can confirm every `metadata.uid` and its observable names made it through.

**Cleanup:** ingested alerts are not hard-deletable via public API. The standard reversibility pattern is to set `status=RESOLVED` and `analystVerdict=TRUE_POSITIVE_BENIGN` via the bulk-ops mutations in `unified_alerts` so the alert exits the active SOC queue and is tagged as synthetic.

**Multi-indicator alert constraints** (empirically confirmed on
`your-tenant` 2026-04-22):

- **One alert per `POST /v1/alerts` call.** The wire format accepts
  concatenated JSON for N alerts in one body and the gateway returns
  HTTP 202, but the stitcher silently drops all but one of the alerts.
  Callers with many alerts MUST loop. `post_alerts` emits a
  `RuntimeWarning` when `len(alerts) > 1` to flag the hazard. Use
  `post_alert_with_indicators(alert, indicators, ...)` for the safe
  one-at-a-time path.
- **Sleep between `POST /v1/indicators` and `POST /v1/alerts`.** If
  the alert is posted immediately after its indicators, the stitcher
  can resolve `finding_info.related_events[].uid` before the indicator's
  `metadata.uid` is registered on the scope and silently drop the alert
  (HTTP 202 still returned). A ~3s sleep between the two POSTs avoids
  this; reducing below ~2s has been observed to regress on loaded
  tenants. `post_alert_with_indicators` builds the sleep in; callers
  using the low-level `post_indicators` + `post_alerts` path MUST add
  it manually. `test_uam_alert_interface_batch.py` encodes this exact
  sequence.
- Alerts with multiple `resources[]` entries (i.e. indicators spanning
  different `device.uid` values) are silently dropped by the stitcher.
  Return: HTTP 202 at the wire, NEVER surfaces in UAM. The builder
  collapses to a single `resources[]` entry (first indicator's device)
  to avoid this. If you truly need per-indicator assets, emit separate
  alerts.
- Each `finding_info.related_events[]` entry MUST carry `class_uid`,
  `type_uid`, `category_uid`, `activity_id`, `severity_id`, `time`,
  `message`, and enriched `observables[]` (each with `type` +
  `typeName` alongside `type_id`/`name`/`value`). `build_alert_referencing()`
  populates all of these. Omitting any of them tends to cause the
  stitcher to silently drop the alert.
- **`file.hashes` MUST be an OCSF Fingerprint array, not a dict.**
  OCSF 1.6.0 defines `file.hashes` as `Array of Fingerprint objects`:
  `[{"algorithm_id": 3, "algorithm": "SHA-256", "value": "<hex>"}, ...]`.
  Posting `{"sha256": "<hex>"}` (dict form) causes the stitcher to
  silently drop the file indicator even though POST returns 202.
  `build_file_indicator()` emits the correct array shape; custom
  payload builders must follow the same convention (algorithm_id 2=MD5,
  3=SHA-256, 4=SHA-1, 5=SHA-512).
- Multi-indicator stitching is asynchronous. Alerts surface within
  ~30s; individual indicators appear in `alert.rawIndicators` over a
  window of 2-120s. Tests must poll with a grace window, not assert
  immediately.
- **Server-side rendering quirk in `alertWithRawIndicators` GraphQL:**
  when an alert has multiple stitched rawIndicators, the flat-key
  representation (`observables[N].name`/`.value`/`.type_id`) has
  shuffled VALUES on all but the last entry in the array -- keys are
  stable, values get mixed with other fields (e.g. `observables[2].name`
  may return `"smoke-product"` because it was populated from
  `metadata.product.name`). Does NOT affect stitching -- `metadata.uid`
  is correct and the UI reads from a different code path. Programmatic
  consumers should assert on `metadata.uid` presence, not on flattened
  `observables[N].name` fields, in batch mode.

**Tested on `your-tenant` 2026-04-22:**

- `tests/test_uam_alert_interface_single.py` -- CONFIRMED WORKING end-to-end. 1 indicator + 1 alert, indicator stitches inside 30s, cleanup verified.
- `tests/test_uam_alert_interface_batch.py` -- CONFIRMED WORKING end-to-end. 3 indicators batched into one POST, alert with 3 related_events surfaces in UAM, all 3 indicators stitch into `alert.rawIndicators` within 2-5s, cleanup verified. Per-observable name assertion treated as informational due to GraphQL server-side rendering quirk noted above.

See `tests/test_uam_alert_interface_single.py` for the minimum-viable worked example, and `tests/test_uam_alert_interface_batch.py` for a batched 3-indicator / multi-observable / multi-class round-trip.

### Asset linkage on ingested alerts

Ingested alerts always create a synthetic `assets[]` entry derived from `resources[]`; they **never** populate `assets[].agentUuid`. That linkage to real tenant inventory is only established when the alert originates from an installed S1 agent (real detection, STAR rule hit, or Hyperautomation `sendCustomEvent`). No OCSF field combination on the ingest path (tested: `resources[].agent_list`, `device.agent_uuid`, matching real agent UUIDs, `os.type_id` hints, etc.) reconciles against inventory.

What IS controllable is the asset classification. `metadata.product.name` + `metadata.product.vendor_name` on the alert envelope drive `assets[].category` / `assets[].subcategory`:

- Defaults (`smoke-product` / `smoke-vendor`) classify as "Device / Other Device"
- `SentinelOne` / `SentinelOne` classifies as "Server / Virtual Machine"

Pass these via `build_alert_referencing(detection_product=..., detection_vendor=...)` when you want a demo alert to visually resemble an agent-generated alert. `get_alert` now defaults to `_ALERT_DETAIL_FIELDS` which includes the `assets { ... }` block; `list_alerts` / `paginate_alerts` still default to `_ALERT_CORE_FIELDS` (cheap) and accept an explicit `fields=_ALERT_DETAIL_FIELDS` override when callers want the asset join on every edge.

Full empirical matrix including per-field behavior and probing recipes: `references/ASSET_LINKAGE.md`.

## Data source + schema discovery

Before you write queries, dashboards, or detections against an SDL data source, discover two things: (1) what sources exist on this tenant and which are actively ingesting, and (2) for a given source, what attributes the parser actually emits. Hardcoded field lists are the number-one reason queries return 0 rows on a new tenant. This workflow replaces them.

### Step 1 — enumerate sources (`dataSource.name = *`)

```python
from pq import list_data_sources
sources = list_data_sources(client, hours=24, limit=200)
# -> [{"dataSource.name": "SentinelOne", "dataSource.category": "security", "ct": 18304051}, ...]
```

CLI: `python scripts/inspect_source.py --list` prints a ranked table of every source that ingested in the last 24h. If a name the user asked for isn't in the list, fuzzy-match and surface candidates rather than running a query that will return 0.

Rules of thumb:
- There can be multiple rows with the same `dataSource.name` under different `dataSource.category` values (e.g. `SentinelOne / security`, `SentinelOne / None`, `SentinelOne / telemetry`). Treat category as metadata, not part of the name.
- A source with non-zero `ct` in 24h is live. Anything else is either decommissioned, in a different time window, or scoped out of the current token.

### Step 2 — discover the schema for one source (`discover_schema`)

```python
from inspect_source import discover_schema, pick_keys

schema = discover_schema(
    client, "Prompt Security",
    hours=24, sample=150,
    extra_filter="(tag != 'logVolume' OR !(tag = *))",  # ALWAYS exclude logVolume
    backend="auto",   # sync SDL first, LRQ LOG fallback
    escalate=True,    # 1h -> 4h -> 24h until min_events rung satisfied
)
prim_key, action_key = pick_keys(schema)
```

CLI: `python scripts/inspect_source.py --source "<name>" --window 24h`.

Key points:
- Uses the LRQ `LOG` queryType (not PowerQuery). PQ has no wildcard column projection; `| columns *` errors and `| limit N` only returns `timestamp + message`. `LOG` returns every flat attribute the parser emits under `matches[].values`, which is how the Event Search UI populates its "Event properties" panel.
- Sync SDL `/sdl/api/query` is ~30% faster than async LRQ on your-tenant. The dispatcher prefers it and falls back to LRQ LOG on HTTP 404/401/403. Force a backend with `backend="sdl"` or `backend="lrq"` if benchmarking.
- Escalating window (1h -> 4h -> 24h -> requested) keeps busy sources ~3s. Only sparse sources (audit, low-volume demos) pay the full widening cost. Override with `escalate=False` for a single-rung run at `hours=`.
- Each field is classified: `principal_user` / `principal_host` / `principal_ip` / `action` / `temporal` / `network` / `file` / `process` / `grouping_candidate` / `other`. `pick_keys(schema)` returns `(prim_key, action_key)` picked from whatever is populated, preferring `user > hostname > IP`, then shortest name, then exact-name action hits (`action`, `event.type`, `outcome`, `result`, `severity`, ...) in that priority.
- `extra_filter` is passed through verbatim and appended to the base `dataSource.name='...'` filter.

### ALWAYS exclude `tag='logVolume'` from discovery samples

Many SentinelOne parsers emit metric events alongside real data, tagged `tag='logVolume'`. They have `metric`, `value`, `path1` fields and nothing else useful. If you don't exclude them, they crowd out real events in a sample window and the classifier picks `severity` as the action key because it's the only field at 100% populated. Pass:

```python
extra_filter="(tag != 'logVolume' OR !(tag = *))"
```

The `OR !(tag = *)` half keeps sources that don't emit `tag` at all (rather than excluding them as null). `build_source_report.py` always passes this filter. Do the same in any new caller.

### Benchmarked results (5 sources, your-tenant, 24h ceiling)

| Source | Wall | Effective | n sampled | attrs | prim_key | action_key |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SentinelOne | 2.9s | 1h | 150 | 333 | `src.process.eUserName` | `event.type` |
| Windows Event Logs | 3.1s | 1h | 150 | 148 | `winEventLog.data.event.eventData.subjectUserName` | `event.type` |
| FortiGate | 2.5s | 1h | 150 | 247 | `device.name` | `event.type` |
| Zscaler Internet Access | 2.5s | 1h | 150 | 47 | `None` | `action` |
| Prompt Security | 16.8s | 24h | 133 | 59 | `user` | `action` |

Four of five land in ~3s because busy sources satisfy the `min_events=50` threshold on the 1h rung. Only low-volume sources (demo Prompt Security) pay the full escalation cost (1h -> 4h -> 24h = 3 rungs). Reproduce with `python scripts/bench_5_sources.py`.

Zscaler returning `prim_key=None` is a real classifier gap: its user-ish fields are named `deviceowner` / `department` without a separator, so they don't match the `principal_user` regex. This is visible, not hidden. Operators can inspect the `other` class in the report and manually set the prim_key for downstream queries.

### Using the discovered schema in code

```python
base = f"dataSource.name = '{source}' (tag != 'logVolume' OR !(tag = *))"

# volume-by-action breakdown (always safe; default to count() if no action key)
if action_key:
    q = f"{base} | group n=count() by {action_key} | sort -n"
else:
    q = f"{base} | group n=count()"

# per-principal mix (skip if no principal)
if prim_key and action_key:
    q = f"{base} | group n=count() by {prim_key}, {action_key} | sort -n | limit 60"
elif prim_key:
    q = f"{base} | group n=count() by {prim_key} | sort -n | limit 25"
```

`build_source_report.py` is the reference consumer of this pattern. Read it before writing a new pipeline that needs the same keys.

## Source-agnostic baseline + anomaly detection

`scripts/baseline_anomaly.py` is the productionised end-to-end pipeline for behavioral baselining and z-score anomaly detection on ANY data source. It composes the schema-discovery + key-picker + LRQ runner already in this skill, so a caller never has to hand-pick principal/action fields per source.

What it does:

1. Calls `inspect_source.discover_schema()` for the named source and `pick_keys(schema)` to choose `prim_key` (principal — user / host / IP / role) and `action_key` (event.type / activity_name / action). Honors per-source overrides if the caller knows better.
2. Runs N daily count slices (default 30) via `pq.run_pq()` over the baseline window. Daily slicing avoids the LRQ per-call deadline; `max_workers=3` respects the per-user 3 rps cap.
3. Runs one 24h live slice.
4. Merges slices client-side. Supports two baseline strategies: pooled (all daily samples in one bucket) and DoW-stratified (one bucket per day-of-week — eliminates weekday/weekend false-positives).
5. Surfaces three anomaly classes on every run: matched-pair z-score deviations (SPIKE/DROP), silent pairs (baseline → live=0), and new-behavior pairs (live with no baseline).

Usage:

```bash
python scripts/baseline_anomaly.py --source "<name>" --days 30 --stratify dow
python scripts/baseline_anomaly.py --source "Okta" --days 7
python scripts/baseline_anomaly.py --source "FortiGate" --days 30 --stratify dow --principal src.ip.address --action unmapped.action
```

State is checkpointed to disk per source (`baseline_anomaly_<slug>_state.json`) so the script is resumable across runs — use this when working in environments with short shell budgets.

PQ building blocks the script wraps live in the `sentinelone-powerquery` skill at `examples/behavioral-baselines.md`. Read that file when authoring the equivalent as a STAR / PowerQuery Alert detection rule body — the rule-body shape uses `lookup` against a pre-computed baseline table (from `savelookup`) instead of the script's two-window LRQ pattern.

### When to re-run discovery

- Before writing any query against a source you haven't touched on this tenant.
- When a previously-working query starts returning 0 rows (parser may have changed field names after a platform update).
- On tenant handover — different customers enable different parser versions, especially for XDR connectors.
- Before authoring a detection rule body (STAR / Custom Detection / PowerQuery Alert), to confirm the fields the rule references actually exist. Pass the discovered schema through to the rule author in the body of the request.

## CTO report generation pipeline

A source-agnostic pipeline for producing CTO-grade Word + PowerPoint reports on any SDL data source. Three scripts, one JSON artefact.

1. `scripts/build_source_report.py --source "<vendor>" --window <7d|24h|...>`. Runs dimension probes, a unified per-principal query, and a timeline aggregate against the tenant via `scripts/pq.py`, then writes `reports/<slug>_<window>/data.json`. Probes which of `user`, `src.ip.address`, `src.hostname`, `action`, `event.type` actually carry values, so the renderer can skip sections that would otherwise be empty.
2. `scripts/render_charts.py <data.json>`. Emits PNG charts into `reports/<slug>_<window>/charts/`. Pure function of the JSON, no tenant calls.
3. `scripts/build_docx.py <data.json>` and `scripts/build_pptx.py <data.json>`. Read the same JSON, emit `<Slug>_CTO_Report_<window>.docx` and `<Slug>_CTO_Deck_<window>.pptx` next to it. Every chart, section, stat card, and recommendation is gated on `data["dims"]` so a dimension-sparse source (e.g. Windows Event Logs has only `event.type`) produces a shorter but coherent report, not a broken one with empty tiles.

### Data.json contract (renderers depend on this shape)

- `source`, `slug`, `window_label`, `window_start`, `window_end`, `base_filter`.
- `dims`: boolean-per-dimension probe result.
- `summary`: derived metrics. Key fields are `total`, `intervention_rate` (only meaningful if `dims.action`), `prim_key` (name of the principal field actually used: `user`, `src.hostname`, `src.ip.address`, or null), `top_principal_key`, `top_user`, `by_action`, `rank_24h`, `n_slices`.
- `per_user_mix_top10`: the unified top-N-principals-by-action-mix result. The renderer slices this into `by_user`, `by_action_blocks`, `by_user_bypass` rather than running three separate queries. Collector does one PQ; renderer derives the rest.

### Principal key fallback

Order: `user`, then `src.hostname`, then `src.ip.address`, then none. The collector picks the first dim that returned non-null; the renderer reads `summary.prim_key` and labels stat cards and takeaways accordingly (e.g. "Dominant host" vs "Dominant user").

### Renderer gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **Never use em-dashes or en-dashes in any commentary string.** They read as AI-generated. Use commas, colons, or parentheses.
- **Stat card overflow.** Long labels (e.g. "Windows Event Log Creation") wrap through the card edge at 40pt. Use length-based font sizing: len<=7 gets 40pt, <=12 gets 28pt, <=18 gets 20pt, else 16pt.
- **Chart title "dayly" is not a word.** `f"{kind}ly"` where kind="day" is wrong. Use a lookup: `{"day": "Daily", "hour": "Hourly", "week": "Weekly", "month": "Monthly"}`.
- **X-axis label crowding on hourly charts.** A 24-slice timeline rotates 24 timestamps into each other. Sparsify with `ax.set_xticks(ticks[::step])` where `step = max(1, int(len(dates) / 10))`, BEFORE `autofmt_xdate`.
- **Single-series legend clutter.** Gate `ax.legend(...)` on `n_series > 1`. A one-series chart needs no legend; the title carries the meaning.
- **Bar data-labels overlap on dense charts.** Skip them when `len(dates) > 12`. The Y-axis scale is enough for dense timelines.
- **Adaptive title on dimensionless sources.** `title_suffix = "volume by action" if has_action else "volume"`. Don't claim action breakdown when there is none.
- **Recommendations grid leaves empty bottom cell.** With 2 cards, use a single row (not 2x2). With 1 card, full width.
- **Fallback bullets when both `action` and `top_user` are missing.** Otherwise the "CTO takeaways" section renders empty. Fall back to dominant `prim_key`, tenant rank (24h), and the data-lake story.

### Commentary generators

`_intervention_note()`, `_concentration_note()`, `_bypass_note()` in `build_docx.py` and `build_pptx.py` take metric values and return commentary strings gated on thresholds (>=40 high, >=10 moderate, else low). The thresholds are tuned for LLM-app traffic; if they feel off for a new source, edit the thresholds rather than the template strings.

### Running the whole thing

```
# From the skill root, with $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/sentinelone/credentials.json configured.
python scripts/build_source_report.py --source "<vendor>" --window <7d|24h|...>
python scripts/render_charts.py reports/<slug>_<window>/data.json
python scripts/build_docx.py    reports/<slug>_<window>/data.json
python scripts/build_pptx.py    reports/<slug>_<window>/data.json
```

The collector creates `reports/<slug>_<window>/` on first run. The `reports/` directory is `.gitignored`; this skill ships with the framework only, not sample outputs.

## Common high-value workflows

- **Unified alert triage** — `list_alerts(...)` from `unified_alerts` for the modern multi-source alerts inbox (EDR + XDR + Identity + cloud + third-party); use `facets`/`group-by` for volume rollups; `set_alert_status` / `set_analyst_verdict` / `assign_alerts` for triage decisions; `add_alert_note` for context.
- **Threat triage (legacy)** — `GET /threats` filtered by `createdAt__gte` + `resolved=false`; enrich with agent details from `/agents?ids=...`; output a table.
- **Endpoint isolation** — find agent IDs (`/agents` with name/IP filter), confirm count, `POST /agents/actions/disconnect` with filter.
- **Hunt across DV / PowerQuery** -- `POST /sdl/v2/api/queries` with `queryType="LOG"` (S1QL) or `queryType="PQ"` (PowerQuery), then poll `GET /sdl/v2/api/queries/{id}` echoing the `X-Dataset-Query-Forward-Tag` response header. Auth is Bearer, not ApiToken. Legacy `/dv/init-query` + `/dv/query-status` + `/dv/events` + `/dv/events/pq` flows are deprecated (sunset 2027-02-15). See `references/WORKFLOWS.md` Section 4 for the canonical runner.
- **Natural-language hunt via Purple AI** -- Use `mcp__purple-mcp__purple_ai` (Purple MCP). The `purple_query()` Python helper and `scripts/call_purple.py` are non-functional for API tokens (`purpleLaunchQuery NATURAL_LANGUAGE` requires a browser-session teamToken, confirmed 2026-05-03). Only for SDL-telemetry questions; route entity questions to REST.
- **Site/Group inventory** — `/sites`, `/groups`, `/accounts` are the tenant-structure endpoints; many resources require filtering by `siteIds` / `accountIds`.
- **Bulk action audit** — `/activities` is the system-wide audit log; filter by `activityTypes` and `createdAt__gte`.
- **Push alerts + indicators INTO UAM** -- build OCSF payloads, then call `UAMAlertInterfaceClient.post_alert_with_indicators(alert, [...])` once per alert (loop for many). The helper posts indicators, sleeps 3s, and posts the single alert in the one sequence proven to surface cleanly on US1 tenants. See "UAM Alert Interface" section above for the two silent-drop failure modes (multi-alert POST, no sleep) it prevents. Use for pipeline integrations, synthetic-alert generation, and detection testing.
- **CTO report for a data source** -- `python scripts/build_source_report.py --source "<vendor>" --window <7d|24h>` then `scripts/render_charts.py`, `scripts/build_docx.py`, `scripts/build_pptx.py` on the resulting `reports/<slug>_<window>/data.json`. Works for any SDL data source; the renderer gates every section on `dims` so dimension-sparse sources (e.g. Windows Event Logs with only `event.type`) still produce a coherent deck. See "CTO report generation pipeline" for the data contract and renderer gotchas.

## Hyperautomation (HA) — workflow management

API root (confirmed via live network capture 2026-05-03):
```
/web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/v1
```
Auth: same `Authorization: ApiToken <token>` header as all other S1 REST calls.

### Endpoints

| Operation | Method | Path |
|---|---|---|
| List workflows | `GET` | `/workflows?limit=&skip=&siteIds=&sortBy=&sortOrder=` |
| Get single workflow | `GET` | `/workflows/single/{workflowId}/{revisionId}` |
| Workflow filter counts | `GET` | `/workflows/filters-count?siteIds=` |
| Archive (delete) workflow | `POST` | `/workflows/archive` |
| Export all workflows (ZIP) | `GET` | `/workflow-import-export/export` *(confirmed on /public path)* |
| Import workflow | `POST` | `/workflow-import-export/import` *(confirmed on /public path)* |

**Important:** the single-workflow fetch requires BOTH `workflowId` AND `revisionId`. The `revisionId` is the `workflow.version_id` field returned in the list response. `GET /workflows/single/{id}` without a revision returns 404.

**Deletion is a soft-archive, not HTTP DELETE.** The UI calls `POST /workflows/archive` with an array of IDs in the request body.

**Archive body format — unresolved (2026-05):** The archive endpoint is NOT in the swagger. UI DevTools capture suggests the body is `{"ids": ["<v1_uuid>"]}`. Tested variants via API token on the demo tenant: `{"ids": [...]}`, `{"ids": [...], "siteIds": [...]}`, `{"workflowIds": [...]}` — all return HTTP 500. The MCP tool `ha_archive_workflow` also returns 500 on this tenant. This is likely a tenant-level permission restriction on the service user token, not a body format problem. `Hyper Automate.write` scope is confirmed required; even with it, archive may be blocked for service users.

Export/import were not captured in the v1 network trace. They are confirmed working at the `/public` base path; the `/v1` equivalents have not been verified.

### List response shape (key fields)

Each item in `data[]`:
```jsonc
{
  "id": "<workflowUUID>",                     // top-level workflow ID
  "workflow": {
    "id": "<same UUID>",
    "version_id": "<revisionUUID>",            // pass as revisionId to single endpoint
    "name": "...",
    "state": "active|inactive|deactivated|draft",
    "status": "idle|running|...",
    "scope_level": "account|site",
    "scope_id": "<19-digit>",
    "site_name": "<name or null>",
    "created_at": "<iso>",
    "updated_at": "<iso>",
    "version_count": <int>
  },
  "actions": [
    { "id": "<uuid>", "integration_id": "<uuid or null>", "type": "<action_type>" }
  ]
}
```

Action types observed: `singularity_response_trigger`, `manual_trigger`, `http_trigger`, `scheduled_trigger`, `email_trigger`, `http_request`, `condition`, `loop`, `variable`, `delay`, `send_email`, `snippet`, `data_formation`, `wait_for_slack`, `break_loop`, `create_interaction`, `wait_for_interaction`, `llm`.

### filter-count response structure

`GET /workflows/filters-count` returns `data[]` with keys: `states`, `scope_ids`, `trigger_types`, `core_actions`, `tags`, `integrations`. Each entry has `{ count, value, title }`. Use this for summary dashboards (e.g. how many active workflows, which integrations are most used).

### MCP tools

`ha_list_workflows` — list with scope/sort/pagination. Returns `revisionId` alongside each workflow.
`ha_get_workflow` — fetch a single workflow by `workflowId` + optional `revisionId` (auto-resolves from list if omitted).
`ha_archive_workflow` — soft-delete one or more workflows via `POST /workflows/archive`. Confirm with user before calling.
`ha_import_workflow` — create workflow from JSON. Requires Hyper Automate.write permission.
`ha_export_workflow` — export all workflows as ZIP.

### Permissions

`Hyper Automate.view` — read operations (list, get, filter-count, export).
`Hyper Automate.write` — write operations (import, archive). Confirmed: without this permission, import returns 403.

## Using sentinelone-mcp tools for direct console operations

Console operations use the `sentinelone-mcp` MCP tools, which bypass the Amazon Quick sandbox proxy
entirely. Use `s1_api_get`, `s1_api_post`, `uam_list_alerts`, `uam_get_alert`, `uam_set_status`,
and other MCP tools directly instead of falling back to the `sentinelone-mgmt-console-api`
skill scripts. The MCP tools run locally on your machine and make direct HTTPS calls to
`*.sentinelone.net` without proxy interference.
