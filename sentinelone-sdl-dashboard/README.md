# sentinelone-sdl-dashboard (Claude skill)

A Claude skill for designing, authoring, and deploying SentinelOne **Singularity Data Lake (SDL) dashboards**: from a single panel to a full multi-tab SOC dashboard. Covers all panel types, multi-tab layouts, parameters, and full dashboard JSON authoring with community examples.

## Install

Copy this folder into your user skills directory:

```bash
cp -r sentinelone-sdl-dashboard ~/.claude/skills/
```

In Cowork/Claude Code, the path is:

```
/sessions/<session>/mnt/.claude/skills/sentinelone-sdl-dashboard/
```

Or install the full plugin (recommended): see [`sentinelone-skills-plugin/`](../sentinelone-skills-plugin/).

## Usage

This skill has no Python client of its own: dashboards are authored as JSON and deployed via the `sentinelone-sdl-api` skill's `put_file` method. Use alongside:

- **`sentinelone-sdl-api`**: to deploy the dashboard JSON to your SDL tenant (`put_file /dashboards/<name>`)
- **`sentinelone-powerquery`**: to validate and compose the queries inside panels before embedding them

## What this skill does

- Designs tab structure and panel layout for any dashboard use case (SOC, compliance, network, threat hunting, identity)
- Authors correct JSON for all panel types: `line`, `bar`, `pie`, `table`, `number`, `timeline`, `honeycomb`, `markdown`
- Applies query performance rules: `net_rfc1918()`, `| limit 1` on number panels, explicit limits on tables, `timebucket` granularity matched to duration, early filter placement, `estimate_distinct()` for cardinality
- Adds markdown descriptor panels to each tab
- Deploys to SDL via `sentinelone-sdl-api`

## Layout

- `SKILL.md`: instructions Claude reads when the skill triggers.
- `references/panel-type-cheatsheet.md`: JSON schema for every panel type with annotated examples.
- `references/common-queries.md`: ready-to-use PQ queries for security, network, identity, and compliance dashboards.
- `references/community-examples.md`: full dashboard JSON examples from the SentinelOne community.
- `references/lessons-learned.md`: source-agnostic patterns and field requirements from production engagements (PowerQuery feature gaps, full-text cost, naming hygiene, discriminator handling, mandatory validation runner).
- `references/evidence-report-template.md`: required schema for the per-panel JSON, markdown, and PDF the validation runner produces.
- `scripts/panel_safety_check.py`: pre-deploy linter for known-bad panel patterns. Run before every `put_file`.
- `scripts/validate_dashboard.py`: post-deploy panel replay; persists per-panel evidence (sample rows, row count, matchCount, elapsed, errors) and emits a markdown report.
- `scripts/render_validation_pdf.py`: renders the evidence JSON into a leadership-ready PDF with cover, per-tab sections, sample-data tables, and an empty-result appendix.

## Mandatory log-evidence report

Every dashboard delivered with this skill ships with a log-evidence report produced by `scripts/validate_dashboard.py` plus `scripts/render_validation_pdf.py`. The PDF is the leadership deliverable, the markdown stays in version control. See `references/evidence-report-template.md` for the full schema and what a passing dashboard's report looks like.
