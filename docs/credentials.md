# Credentials

All skills and MCP servers read from a single `credentials.json` file. This document covers every key, where to find each one, and how to configure the MCP servers.

---

## credentials.json keys

```json
{
  "S1_CONSOLE_URL":       "https://usea1-yourorg.sentinelone.net",
  "S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN": "eyJ...your-api-token...",
  "S1_HEC_INGEST_URL":    "https://ingest.us1.sentinelone.net",
  "SDL_XDR_URL":          "https://xdr.us1.sentinelone.net",
  "SDL_LOG_WRITE_KEY":    "0Z1Fy0...",
  "SDL_LOG_READ_KEY":     "0tzj...",
  "SDL_CONFIG_WRITE_KEY": "0mXas6...",
  "SDL_CONFIG_READ_KEY":  "0MQTx..."
}
```

| Key | Required for | How to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `S1_CONSOLE_URL` | Everything | Your console URL, e.g. `https://usea1-acme.sentinelone.net`. No trailing slash. |
| `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` | Mgmt Console REST, PowerQuery LRQ, UAM GraphQL, Purple AI GraphQL, SDL config ops (Management Z SP5+) | Settings > Users > Service Users > Create Service User > copy the API token. |
| `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` | UAM alert/indicator ingest, SDL log ingest | Region-specific HEC host, e.g. `https://ingest.us1.sentinelone.net`. Look up yours at [SentinelOne Endpoint URLs by Region](https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000004961). |
| `SDL_XDR_URL` | SDL API operations (list/get/put config files, PowerQuery via SDL client) | Your SDL tenant URL, e.g. `https://xdr.us1.sentinelone.net`. Region-specific; same reference as above. |
| `SDL_LOG_WRITE_KEY` | `hec_ingest` only | Singularity Data Lake > menu next to username > API Keys > Log Access Keys > New Key (Log Write). See [SDL API Keys](https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000006763). |
| `SDL_LOG_READ_KEY` | SDL V1 query via SDL client (fallback) | Same location, Log Read Access. |
| `SDL_CONFIG_WRITE_KEY` | `sdl_put_file` (parser/dashboard deploy) | Singularity Data Lake > API Keys > Configuration Access Keys > New Key (Config Write). |
| `SDL_CONFIG_READ_KEY` | `sdl_list_files`, `sdl_get_file` | Same location, Config Read Access. |

`S1_CONSOLE_URL` and `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` are the minimum required for most operations. Add the SDL keys only when you need log ingest or parser/dashboard deployment.

**Important:** `SDL_CONFIG_WRITE_KEY` does NOT grant log read access. If your SDL queries return 403, force-clear the scoped keys so auth falls through to the console JWT:

```python
c.keys["log_read_key"] = ""
c.keys["config_read_key"] = ""
```

## Token types

The S1 API has two token types and they are not interchangeable for all operations:

| Token type | Created via | Visible in UI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service User token | Settings > Users > Service Users | No: workflows/rules created with this token are invisible to human users in the UI | Use for programmatic API access |
| Personal Console User token | Settings > Users > My User > API Token | Yes: objects created are visible and attributed to the user | Required for Hyperautomation workflows to appear in the UI |

For most skills, a service user token is correct. If you need Hyperautomation workflows to be visible and editable in the console UI, use a personal console user token.

**Multi-scope tokens:** Some endpoints reject service user tokens scoped to more than one account with `HTTP 403 code 4030010`. Affected endpoints include `/threat-intelligence/iocs`. Use a single-scope token for those operations by adding:

```json
{
  "S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN_SINGLE_SCOPE": "eyJ...your-single-scope-token..."
}
```

The skills auto-detect and fall back to this key when the primary token is rejected.

## Resolution order

Credentials are resolved in this priority order (highest wins):

1. Environment variables in the MCP configuration (Settings > Capabilities > MCP)
2. `credentials.json` in the repo folder or a parent directory (auto-discovered by sentinelone-mcp walking up the directory tree)
3. `~/.config/sentinelone/credentials.json` (fallback for terminal sessions)

---

## Setting up credentials via MCP environment variables (recommended)

The recommended approach is to set credentials as environment variables on each MCP server in Amazon Quick's settings:

1. Open **Settings > Capabilities > MCP**
2. Click the MCP server entry (e.g. `sentinelone-mcp`)
3. Add each credential as an environment variable

This keeps secrets out of files on disk. See [installation.md](./installation.md#step-2-configure-mcp-servers) for the full list per server.

---

## Setting up credentials.json (fallback)

If you prefer a file-based approach (e.g. for the Python scripts in `scripts/`), copy the example file and edit it:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cp credentials.example.json credentials.json
${EDITOR:-nano} credentials.json
```

```powershell
# Windows
Copy-Item .\credentials.example.json credentials.json
notepad credentials.json
```

Place `credentials.json` in the repo root or any parent directory. The MCP server and skill scripts walk up the directory tree to find it automatically.

---

## Setting up MCP servers in Amazon Quick

The MCP servers receive credentials via environment variables configured in **Settings > Capabilities > MCP**. Add each server with its environment variables:

**sentinelone-mcp:**
- Command: `npx`
- Args: `-y @pmoses-s1/sentinelone-mcp`
- Env: `S1_CONSOLE_URL`, `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL`, `SDL_XDR_URL`, `SDL_LOG_WRITE_KEY`, `SDL_LOG_READ_KEY`, `SDL_CONFIG_WRITE_KEY`, `SDL_CONFIG_READ_KEY`

**purple-mcp:**
- Command: `uvx`
- Args: `--from git+https://github.com/Sentinel-One/purple-mcp.git purple-mcp --mode stdio`
- Env: `PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_BASE_URL`, `PURPLEMCP_CONSOLE_TOKEN`

**virustotal:**
- Command: `npx`
- Args: `-y @burtthecoder/mcp-virustotal`
- Env: `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`

> **Threat intel MCP:** Replace `virustotal` with your organisation's approved threat intelligence MCP if different. Any MCP that provides file hash, IP, domain, and URL lookup tools works. The CLAUDE.md operating instructions require multi-source confirmation before a TRUE POSITIVE or CRITICAL verdict: they do not mandate a specific provider.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ for `sentinelone-mcp` and `@burtthecoder/mcp-virustotal` via `npx` (`node --version`)
- `uv` for `purple-mcp`: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`, then open a new terminal and run `uvx --version`
- A VirusTotal API key (free tier is fine) from [virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com)

Restart Amazon Quick after adding the servers. All servers appear under connected MCP tools.

## Verifying credentials work

After setup, run the quick test:

```bash
cd s1-aws-quick-skills/sentinelone-mgmt-console-api
pip install requests
python scripts/s1_client.py
```

This prints the first 5 accounts and runs 4 parallel GETs to confirm auth and connectivity.

To run a full non-destructive sweep of every readable endpoint:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test_queries.py --workers 12
```

Results land in `references/tenant_capabilities.{json,md}`.
