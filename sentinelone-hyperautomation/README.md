# sentinelone-hyperautomation (Amazon Quick skill)

An Amazon Quick skill for designing and generating SentinelOne Hyperautomation workflow JSON, with optional live console import via API.

## What it does

- Generates valid Hyperautomation workflow JSON from a plain-language description
- Covers all workflow trigger types: alert, schedule, webhook, manual, email
- Supports core actions (conditions, loops, variables, HTTP requests, delays) and integration-backed actions (SentinelOne, M365, Slack, VirusTotal, etc.)
- Validates the generated JSON against schema rules before presenting it
- Optionally imports, activates, and triggers workflows on a live console via the Hyperautomation API
- Warns about integrations that require pre-configuration in the console before import

## Install

This skill ships as part of the skills folder. Add the `s1-aws-quick-skills` folder to Amazon Quick (Settings > Capabilities > Folders) and it is included automatically.

To install individually, copy this folder into your user skills directory:

```bash
# Add the s1-aws-quick-skills folder in Amazon Quick:
# Click the folder icon (📁) in chat → Add folder → select this repo
```

## Configure

Set credentials as environment variables in the MCP configuration (Settings → Capabilities → MCP) inside the `sentinelone-mcp` server entry (recommended), or drop a `credentials.json` into your workspace folder for direct skill use:

```json
{
  "S1_CONSOLE_URL": "https://usea1-acme.sentinelone.net",
  "S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN": "eyJ...your-console-user-api-token...",
  "S1_HEC_INGEST_URL": "https://ingest.us1.sentinelone.net"
}
```

Use a **Console User (personal) API token**, not a Service User token. Workflows imported with a Service User token are owned by that service account and invisible to human users in the console UI.

`S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` is the SentinelOne HEC ingest host (region-specific: see [SentinelOne Endpoint URLs by Region](https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000004961)). It is not used by this Hyperautomation skill, but is shown here so the credentials file is consistent across all skills in this repo (the mgmt-console skill's UAM Alert Interface uses it for OCSF alert/indicator ingest).

## Usage

Just describe the workflow in plain language:

- "Build a workflow that isolates an endpoint when a critical threat alert fires"
- "Create a scheduled workflow that runs a PowerQuery every morning and posts results to Slack"
- "Generate a Hyperautomation workflow that enriches alerts with VirusTotal lookups"

Amazon Quick will ask clarifying questions if needed, warn about any integrations that require pre-configuration, generate the workflow JSON, and optionally push it directly to your console.

## Layout

- `SKILL.md`: instructions Amazon Quick reads when the skill triggers
- `references/workflow-schema.md`: envelope and action structure
- `references/building-blocks.md`: exact shape of every action type
- `references/functions-reference.md`: `{{Function.X()}}` syntax and PowerQuery patterns
- `references/validation-rules.md`: pre-output checklist
- `references/api-integration.md`: Hyperautomation API reference (import, activate, trigger, list)
